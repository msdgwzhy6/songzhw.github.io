### A question about EventBus 3
EventBus3 is released for a while. After taking a lookt at its source code, I has some doubts about its performance.

EventBus3 is using runtime annotation. 
```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.METHOD})
public @interface Subscribe {
    ThreadMode threadMode() default ThreadMode.POSTING;
    boolean sticky() default false;
    int priority() default 0;
}
```

Then the code need to use reflection to parse the information the @Subscribe annotation carries.
```java
        for (Method method : methods) {
            int modifiers = method.getModifiers();
            if ((modifiers & Modifier.PUBLIC) != 0 && (modifiers & MODIFIERS_IGNORE) == 0) {
                Class<?>[] parameterTypes = method.getParameterTypes();
                if (parameterTypes.length == 1) {
                    Subscribe subscribeAnnotation = method.getAnnotation(Subscribe.class);
```

As we know, runtime annotation, or reflection, is bad for the performance. So it’s natual for me to conclude that EventBus3 must have a worse performance than EventBus2. 

But the performance result actually slap my face right away.

The above graph shows the resulting speed in registrations per second (higher is better). As we can see, the EventBus3 without Index is indeed slower than EventBus2. The reason is that analysis I did above.

But what is “EventBus 3 with Index”? and Why did it much faster than EventBus2?

### How does Eventbus2.4 work?
Before answering this question, we need to understand how EventBus 2.4 works?

```java
eventBus.register(this);

public void onEvent(AnyEventType event) {
    /* Do something */
}
```

When we regesiter one Subscriber using `eventBus.register(this)`, actually, we iterate all the method in that subscriber object.  Here is what happend this registration:
1. call `eventBus.register(subscriber)`
2. EventBus iterates this subscriber object, finds out all the method starts with “onEvent”
3. EventBus then saves all these methods we just found out, say in a HashMap<Event, Method>
4. When we got an event, we iterate the HashMap, find out where this method is. If we do find one method, then we invoke it.

We now understand how it works. If you want to improve it, how should you do?

First of all, we need to locate which part costs most time? 
: The answer is registration.  We need to iterate the subscriber object using reflection to get all the subscriber method. This is time consuming.  Maybe we can do something about it.

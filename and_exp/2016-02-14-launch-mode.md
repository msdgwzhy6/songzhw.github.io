#Activity Launch Mode

# adb shell dumpsys activity
This command can give you a clear view of each task, like how many tasks do you have, which activities are in which task. 

Now I have one picture of this command's output.

From this output, we can see, now ,we have two Task (#103, #102).

Task #103 : affinity = "cn.six.task2", size = 3 (it has three activities in it)<br/>
	-- Activity One <br/>
	-- Activity Three<br/>
	-- ActivityTwo<br/>

Task #102 : affinity = "cn.six.adv", size = 1<br/>
	-- Activity One<br/>
	
With this "adb shell dumpsys activity" command, we can explor the LaunchMode easier.	s

# Default

The Default system always creates a new instance of the activity in the target task and routes the intent to it.

"Default" is also the default mode when you assign no launch mode to an Activity, which means if you do not assign any launch mode to a Activity, then that Activity will be the "default" launch mode.


# SingleTop

If an instance of the "SingleTop" activity already exists at the top of the target task, the system routes the intent to that instance through a call to itsonNewIntent()Â method, rather than creating a new instance of the activity.


p.s. It's **NOT** clear_top !!!

# SingleTask

This is the most tricky one, and I have to spend much more time to explain it. And examples are a good way to explain this complex launch mode.

## 1. A(Default) -> B(singleTask)
We have two Activity, A and B, and A is default mode, B is singleTask mode. Now A jump to B. 

Android documents says, "The system(SingleTask) creates the activity at the root of a new task and routes the intent to it".  So it must be like this, right?
Task 1  | Task 2
 :-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
 A  | B


But actually, when we run the "adb shell dumpsys  activity", we found out that B is strangely in the same task with A.
Task 1  | Task 2
 :-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
 A <br/>
 B | 


# SingleInstance


# Conclusion

Default  |   SingleTop |  SingleTask                  |  SingleInstance 
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

# How to keep agile?

## introduction
Since 2008, agile development starts to become famous among the software company in China. Until now, almost every software/Internet company are followed the agile development principles. 

I am a total fan of agile development, and I am happy to see every programmer work with me are agile. Agile development will definitely make our project more accurate, more controllable. However, I notice that the agile tide maybe becomes something I do not expected.

## The overused principles




## The other best agile principles



## My thinking
### Meeting
I was totally root for the words : "If you cannot make a decision in the 5-minute meeting, then you should not host a meeting. "

When you gather around a lot of people (PD, developer, QA, ... ) to have a meeting, and lots of them attended with their laptop, then the meeting actually has a rotting smells. 

It's because they are not so much interested in this topic of this meeting. Probably, we should ask them to attend this meeting. 

My principle is : **Prepare before the meeting**. If you want to discuss with one or two person, do it before the meeting. Meeting is the only option when you all are have a conclusion to declare, or you all have different opinions and need someone to make a decision for you guys. 

So If you can not finish the topic in 5 minutes, you should not organized a meething. 

If you only need to discuss something, just discuss it with the right person, rather than all of the team watching you two discussing.

If we all obey these two principle, I think our meeting will not be a problem.

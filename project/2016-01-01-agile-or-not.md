# How to keep agile?

## introduction
Since 2008, agile development starts to become famous among the software company in China. Until now, almost every software/Internet company are followed the agile development principles. 

I am a total fan of agile development, and I am happy to see every programmer work with me are agile. Agile development will definitely make our project more accurate, more controllable. However, I notice that the agile tide maybe becomes something I do not expected.

## The overused principles

### daily standing meeting?

A lot of people, including PM, PD, RD, QA, UED, stand in a circle. Everyone tells the meeting host(usually PM) what did I do yesterday, and did I have problems. PM may not understands all the problems. He just take a note about it and send a daily progress email laer. Is this scene familiar?

I am a developer , also a PM, and a team leader. I have attended many daily standing meeting, which makes me realized the disadvantage of it.

A PM who is or was not a technique developer, may not understand the problems you reported. He just hear and paste it in the email. A severe problem may not cause enough attention, and delay the whole project.

So the daily standing meeting becomes more and more like a mere formality. 

If PM is a developer or QA, he or she knows how the whole procedure, and knows the sorder of severity， a daily standing meeting is uncessary. You know all the problems by asking team worker occasionally， or encouring the team worker to report problems in time. 


### should we totally abondan the daily meeting?

The answer is no.  

1. When most of your team worker is not so active, then you may need a daily meeting to push them to report the problems to you. 

2. When the project is urgent , like you have only two weeks to release a version, every day is precious. In this case, any problems lasting more than one day is a timing bomb and we should have the daily standing meeting. 


Take me for example, my mobile team are active and positive. They will report to me when they counter some problems and aske me how to resolve it. Then I have a chance to get known the project procedure better. And our project is about 3 or 4 weeks per release, which is not so long. In this case, I have a strong controlling force in my project, and my project is not a urgent one, so I decide not to hold standing meeting every day.



### a lot of Meeting?
I was totally root for the words : "If you cannot make a decision in the 5-minute meeting, then you should not host a meeting. "

When you gather around a lot of people (PD, developer, QA, ... ) to have a meeting, and lots of them attended with their laptop, then the meeting actually has a rotting smells.  They are not so much interested in this topic of this meeting. Probably, we should not ask them to attend this meeting. 

My principle is : **Prepare before the meeting**. If you want to discuss with one or two person, do it before the meeting. Meeting is the only option when you all are have a conclusion to declare, or you all have different opinions and need someone to make a decision for you guys. 
 
**Rule One**
If you can not finish the topic in 5 minutes, you should not organized a meething. 

**Rule Two**
If you only need to discuss something, just discuss it with the right person, rather than all of the team watching you two discussing.

If we all obey these two principles, I think our meeting will not be a problem.

# Introduction to Koltin

In the blog *Clean App (2)*, I have list some difficulties in the android development. One of them is java. 

Java is a great language, but it is a little heavy for the development in Android. Every time I write findViewById, or one interface with only one function, or the try-catch, I feel bored and anxious. Do I have some solution to do about it ?

Since I feel java maybe not the best answer, I start to search other candidates.

## Groovy ?

## Kotlin !

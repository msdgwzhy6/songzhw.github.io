<h2>About Me</h2>
I am Songzhw, an Android developer and a team manager. I try to build clean, safe, testable Android app, and also have interest in Ruby, Groovy, Python and other programming languages. <p>

This is my place to record my thoughts, my work result, and my doubts. <br/>
Welcome to here.<p>

If you want to share something with me, too, please contact me with songzhw2012@gmail.com

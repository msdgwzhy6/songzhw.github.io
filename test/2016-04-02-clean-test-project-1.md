# How to build a clean, test project for your app?

I introduce some test tools for you to start applying test to your app.  I do not want to talk too much the detail of using Espresso or UI Automator, since the introductions are everywhere in the Internet. Instead, I want to introduce a nice architecture of one test project.


## 1. The normal development and test codes
### 1.1 app/main



###  1.2. app/androidTest


## 2. Start to build a cleaner test project

# How to decouple an Android project?

A "God Class" is an object that controls way too many other objects in the system and has grown beyond all logic to become the class that does everything.

We all know that Activity in Android is a "God Class". We normally init views in here, request the server api here, and also save the data temporarily here, refresh the view here, start the animation here, observe the click/select/check event here .....

Oh God, Activity really is such a pity. It has to do so much work in our best interest.  Worst of it was that we have to read hundreds or thousands of lines before we add our new feature.
And we can not be sure our new change will not affect the old system.

What can we do about this?

## Jump Out of Confusion Zone : MVC, MVP, MVVM

The difference among these three patterns is complicated. I will not say too much about it right now. But we should know that they are very similar , and they are try to build a decoupled system.

Since the concept of "M V C", "M V P", "M V VM" is too complex to explain in a short way, I will call the clean pattern as "MVC" temperarily. Yes, we don't care what name is this decopule pattern, we only care about the result.

Model : store the date, manipulate data<br/>
View  : show the UI to the user<br/>
Controller(/Presenter/ViewModel) : ?? (we will discuss it later) <br/>

Model and View are less controversial, and they are easily to reuse. <br/>

Model can easily transfer from a phone app to a pad app. The logic is very similar.<br/>

View can be reuse too. There are plenty of custom view in Github. We can easily reuse them.


The middle interface, known as Controller or Presenter, or ViewModel,  is much harder to explain.
But we have two fundamental principal:
 * <b> View can not access Model, and vice versa </b>
 * <b> View can only access Controller; Model can only access Controller; Controller can access both View and Model.</b>

Since we have a clear thought, the next step is much easier:
 - View : [layout xml, Activity, Adapter, Fragment]
    - has the reference of Controller, and init the Controller
    - init View
    - setOn***Listener() { controller.doSomething(); }
    - refresh the UI
    - do the animation

 - Model : [Logical classes]

 - Controller(/Presenter/ View Model) ： [Custom classes: ActivityController, FragmentController ...]
    - has referenece of View and Model
    - filter
    - connect the server, and get the result
    - make Mdel do his job
    - notify View to refresh the UI


## Sample

"talk is cheap, show me the code".

1. Show the whole list
![](/imgs/20151121_01.jpg)

2. click "Standard Chartered Bank" to delete it
![](/imgs/20151121_02.jpg)

3. click the top TextView to revert the last deletion
![](/imgs/20151121_03.jpg)


Features:
 * list shows many banks
 * click one item of the list, delete this bank
 * when you delete one bank, the TextView on top will show. And if you click the TextView, app will revert the last deletion


#### [View]
```java

public class CardActivity : BaseActivity(){
    var adapter : CardAdapter by Delegates.notNull()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_cards)

        var presenter = CardPresenter(this)
        presenter.initData()

        adapter = CardAdapter(this)
        adapter.data = emptyList<String>()
        lvCards.adapter = adapter

        lvCards.setOnItemClickListener { adapterView, view, pos, lpos ->
            presenter.removeItem(pos)
        }


        tvCardsTop.visibility = View.GONE
        tvCardsTop.setOnClickListener{ view ->
            presenter.revertDelete()
        }
    }

    // refresh the whole list view
    fun refreshList(data : List<String>){
        adapter.data = data
        adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()
    }

    // revert the last deletion, refresh view
    fun refreshAfterRevert(data : List<String>){
        tvCardsTop.visibility = View.GONE
        refreshList(data)
    }

    // delete one Item, refresh view
    fun refreshAfterDeleteItem(deletedItem : String , data : List<String>){
        tvCardsTop.visibility = View.VISIBLE
        tvCardsTop.text = "You have deleted ${deletedItem}.  Click here to revert the deletion!"
        refreshList(data)
    }


}
```


### [Presenter/Controller]
```java
public class CardPresenter(var view: CardActivity){
    var model : CardModel by Delegates.notNull()
    var cards : List<String> by Delegates.notNull()
    var cachedDeleted : String by Delegates.notNull()

    init{
        model = CardModel()
    }

    fun initData(){
        // mock the server connecting
        Observable.just("")
            .delay(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .subscribe{
                cards = model.bankCards
                view.refreshList(cards)
            }
    }


    fun removeItem( pos : Int){
        cachedDeleted = cards.get(pos)
        model.deleteItem(cachedDeleted)
        cards = model.bankCards
        view.refreshAfterDeleteItem(cachedDeleted, cards)
    }

    fun revertDelete(){
        model.addItem(cachedDeleted)
        view.refreshAfterRevert(model.bankCards)
    }

}
```


### [Model]
```java
public class CardModel {

    var bankCards = arrayListOf("Citi Bank",
            "Standard Chartered Bank",
            "Royal Bank",
            "China Bank")

    fun deleteItem(badLuck : String){
        bankCards.remove(badLuck)
    }

    fun addItem(item : String){
        bankCards.add(item)
    }

}
```



## Improvement to be continue

Actually, we can abstract two new interface : ICardView, ICardModel. CardActivity implements the ICardview, and CardModel implements the ICardModel. We only have to pass these two interface to Controller, instead of two specific class(CardActivity, CardModel).

The benefit of using interface :
 * make our test easier. We now can test Presenter easily by translate a fake class which just implements IView.
 * easy to change View/Model reference to another View/Model class.

Of course, there are one major defect: It is hard to code.
When you want to add a new action to the View, you have to add it to ICardView,  and CardActivity too.
This will make our life a little miserable.


## Conclusion
The preceding codes actually are the MVP pattern.

The difference among the three confusing pattern (mvc, mvp, mvvm) actually is:

![](/imgs/20151122_01.jpg)

p.s. MVVM is actually a little different from MVP. It usually has a data binding system, like Griffon. We maybe talk about MVVM later.

Of course, we don't care the name, but we design the app framework to reduce the decouple, to increse the reuse, to make our test easier. Under this construction, we can build a app framework in our own way.

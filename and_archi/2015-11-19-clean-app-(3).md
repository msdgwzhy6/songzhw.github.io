# One Prominent Sample of MVC

Griffon is a brilliant UI system, written by Groovy. And I really love it. If you are a fan of Rails of Ruby or Grails, you will fall in love with Griffon too. Because Griffon has adopted many of  Rails/Grails's best practices, including Model-View-Controller, convertion-over-configuration, a modern dynamic language(aka. Groovy), domain-specific langage(DSLs), and the builder pattern.

For us, Android developer, we now only focus on the MVC pattern in Griffon, to see what benefit or good thought Griffon can give us.

The original Swing project can be MVC too, but most of them combine the view and the controller in the same class (for example, JButton) while keeping the model in a sepaarate class(ButtonModel).
 * Domain Model : it describe the application in terms of entities. Like *Company*, *Employee* class.
 * Model : The model in Griffon is responsible for **hodling the data** and **providing basic relationships within this data** .
 Using Observer pattern, or we called "Data-Binding", model can indirectly affect the View.
 * View : **Displaying the data coming from the model using <i>Data-Binding</i>**
 * Controller : Command Center. Every operation that affects the model from the outside should be scrutinized and given the green light by a controller.
 The controller then carries the burden of making all choices: Whether data should be affected, and wht the view's next state should be.
 The model may update the view indirectly with new data as long as the view is listening to changes from the model, but it should not cause a change in the view's state without the controller's consent.


Enough theory. Let's write a sample, and face the beauty of Griffon.


## Sample
### Result
A simple window to submit your name and address. You can also press "reset" to clear all your input.

### View

If you are familiar with swing, then the preceding code is not hard for you. You first use a GridLayout, then use Label(TextView in Android) , TextField(EditText in Android), and Button later.

What interest us is the following code.
```groovy
textField(text: bind(target:model, 'pwd', mutual:true)
button('Reset', actionPerformed: controller.reset)
```

1. TextField/EditText is binding with one property in model. When this property changes, the TextField/EditText will changed the text automatically.
2. The click event of the button, is distributed to the controller's one function: reset()
3. With the help of Griffon, view already has the reference of Model and Controller, and you do not need to declare these two variable.


### Controller

1. When you click "Reset" button, the controller's reset() will be called
2. You only have to change the model. Thanks to data-binding, the view will change automatically.
3. reset() funciton also has a annotaion
```java
@Threading(Threading.Policy.SKIP)
```
UI can only be refrshed in the UI main thread in Android, and so is Griffon.
Now, you can easily do the threading job with a single Threading, to tell the system which thread this function is called.


### Model

![](/imgs/20151121_06.jpg)

1. ``` @PropertyListener(checkEnable) ``` means every property changes in FormModel will trigger the checkEnable function.

2. ``` @Bindable ``` in FormModel , means every property in FormModel is view-binded data.  The changes in data will property 



### Conclusion

Griffon's UI code are really beautiful. And what we can lear from it as a Android developer?

1. View is responsible for 
 * init views
 * register the click/touch listener, and transfer the click/touch event to controller<p>

2. Unlike Griffon , we want less decouple in Android App. So we do not want the view to hold a reference of Model. And vice versa.  Now the controller is actullay a real command center. Controller will tell the model or view what to do. But view does not know the existing of model. <p>

3. again, I still want to emphrase it:
View only has the reference of Controller<br/>
Model only has the reference of Controller<br/>
Controller has references of Model and View <p>


In the next blog, I will talk about the MVC practise in Android app.

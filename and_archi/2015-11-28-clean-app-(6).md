We already talked the multiple problems in Android development in the second blog : "2015.11.17 Clean App (2) : Boilerplate in Android".

From then on, we fix the boilerplate problem in the "clean app(2)" blog, and fix the God Activity class and MVC framework problem in the "clean app(3) / (4) / (5)". Now the unresolved problems are only:
* Complex Multi-Thread Handling 
* (Java) file stream, try-catch, no block, no first-class function, no AOP ....

In this blog and maybe later multiple blogs, we will try to fix the last problem : the java language that maybe a little clumsy nowadays.

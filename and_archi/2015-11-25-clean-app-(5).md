# An example in real life

We list all the usable payments in the process of pay, like account balance, debit cards, credit cards ...  So, we have a page like this:
// img

Now, we want to transfer money from one bank card to account balance. Of course, we should give the user the chance of shift from one bank card to another bank card. 

So we need to reuse the page in two different situations. However, the click event in each situation is different, and the UI in each situation has a little difference too. That means , we should reuse the View, and put the unreusable part to the specific Presenter. Yes, we should have one View, and two Presenter classes.

Since the data in two situations both includes account balance and multiple bank cards, so one Model is enough.

Here is what I do:

 #### [View]


 #### [Model]



 #### [Presenter -- IPaymentPresenter]


 #### [Presenter -- NormalPayPresenter]



 #### [Presenter -- DepositPresenter]

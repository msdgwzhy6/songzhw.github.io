# Android Fingerprint
Android 6.0 has imported the fingerprint. As a person who is firstly meet the fingerprint in Android, I want to introduce fingerprint from the very begining.

##  1. Set the fingerprint
When I got the Nexus 6P, I boot the phone.<p>

step 1 : You tell Android6.0 that you want to have some kind of password to unlokc your phone. The choices are fingerprint, pin code, lock pattern. <br/>
        -- I choosed "FingerPrint".

step 2 : Android6.0 asked you to set pin code / lock pattern firstly.<br/>
        -- I choosed "lock pattern" and set the lock pattern.

setp 3 : Before letting you set the fingerprint, Android specially tell you "Fingerprint is not as secure as pin code or lock pattern".<br/>

step 4 : gathering your one fingerprint serveral times, to make sure the result is accurate.<br/>

p.s : you can add more fingerprints later in the "settings --> security --> Nexus Imprints"

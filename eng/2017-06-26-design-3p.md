OCP, SIP, LSP, DIP

-- conform to OCP ;  if OCP is applied well, 
-- violate OCP

If OCP is applied well, further cahnges of that kind are achieved by adding new code, not by changing old code that already work. 
What are the traps that will cause us to create hierarchies that do not conform to OCP?
This change immediately satisfies both DIP and OCP.

requirements change
extend the module with new behaviors that satisfy those changes

be closed against (new change)
close ...(function) against ...(change)
   : close the drawAllShapes function against ordering issue

the likely kinds of change
how do we know which change are likey?

LSP: subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

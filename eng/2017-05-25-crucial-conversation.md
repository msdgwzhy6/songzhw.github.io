# Crucial Conversation

 We want to achieve the result through a crucial conversation. But xometime the curcial conversation goes wrong way somehow.  How can we improve the crucial conversation? 



## Three principle: 
1. The first thing you need to rememeber is : the only person you can work on is yourself! <br/>
So the improvment depends on you. You have to figure out how to get others feel safe, how to make others to continue the conversation with you, and how make yourself calm.
2. Focus on what you really want<br/>

3. Refuse the fool's choice : Silence or Violence
-- Slience :  silence ; sarcasm; sugarcoating; change subject

-- Violence : controlling, labeling, attacking

## Safty

When people feel unsafe, they will become silent or violent. So we need to step out, make it safe, then step in. 

Remember the last time someone gave you different feedback and you didn't become defensive?
Say a friend said some things to you that most people might get upset over. And you didn't attack him or her. That means you trust his or her purpose so you were willing to listen to some pretty tough feedback. 

How can others feel safe when they believe you are out to harm them? 
Soon, every word out of you mouth is suspect. You can't even utter a harmless "Good Morning" without other interpreting it in a negative way. 


## Two things to remember before/in the conversation
**Mutual Purpose** (MP) - entrance condition



**Mutual Respect** (MR) - continuance condition

When under attack, our heart can take a sudden and unconscious turn, and we often stop worrying about our real goal and start to looking for ways to win, punish, or keep the silence.

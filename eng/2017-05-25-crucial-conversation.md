Crucial Conversation

 We want to achieve the result through a crucial conversation. But xometime the curcial conversation goes wrong way somehow.  How can we improve the crucial conversation? 

## Three principle: 
1. The first thing you need to rememeber is : the only person you can work on is yourself! <br/>
So the improvment depends on you. You have to figure out how to get others feel safe, how to make others to continue the conversation with you, and how make yourself calm.
2. Focus on what you really want<br/>

3. Refuse the fool's choice : Silence or Vilence

Two things to remember before/in the conversation
**Mutual Purpose** (MP) - entrance condition



**Mutual Respect** (MR) - continuance condition

When under attack, our heart can take a sudden and unconscious turn, and we often stop worrying about our real goal and start to looking for ways to win, punish, or keep the silence.
